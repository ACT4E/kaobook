# kaobook

A LaTeX class for books, reports or theses.

## Acknowledgements

This class is based on the work of [Ken Arroyo 
Ohori](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/ken/en/) for his doctoral thesis. The 
main ideas behind the layout can be found in this [blog 
post](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/ken/en/2016/04/17/a-1.5-column-layout-in-latex.html). 

The [Tufte-LaTeX class](https://github.com/Tufte-LaTeX/tufte-latex) has 
also been a source of ideas about the layout.

Finally my gratitude goes also to [Vel](https://www.vel.nz/) for his 
patience and his invaluable suggestions about the design.

## Description

The salient features of the class are as follows.

* Wide margin to house captions, small figures or tables, and textual 
  notes.

* Mini table of contents in the margin at the start of each chapter.

* Easily-customisable chapter headings.

* Flexible citations with references both in the margin and in the 
  bibliography at the end.

* Powered by KOMA-Script.

* Many commands have been redefined to ease the life of the user.

A better description can be found at [LaTeX 
Templates](http://www.latextemplates.com/template/kaobook). If you think 
that a PDF is worth a thousand words, have a look at [this](main.pdf).

## Usage

The class is documented and exemplified in the [main.pdf](main.pdf) 
file. To actually use it you can either clone the [Git Hub 
repository](https://github.com/fmarotta/kaobook) or, much more easily, 
find the template at [LaTeX 
Templates](http://www.latextemplates.com/template/kaobook).

## Contributing

Do you like the design, but you found a bug? Is there something you 
would have done differently? Any contribution is welcome! Moreover, even 
if you'd rather not tamper with the code it is *not* forbidden to send 
me the documents you compiled using the kaobook class.

Since the content of this repository is published at [LaTeX 
Templates](http://www.latextemplates.com/), if you wish to contribute by 
changing the code you must follow the style guidelines of the site: 
extensive commenting and clear separation of the code into nicely 
formatted blocks.
