# Kaobook

A LaTeX class for books, reports or theses.

## Credits

This class is based on the work of [Ken Arroyo 
Ohori](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/ken/en/) for his doctoral thesis. The 
main ideas behind the layout can be found in this [blog 
post](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/ken/en/2016/04/17/a-1.5-column-layout-in-latex.html)

## Documentation

Work in progress

## Contributing

Do you like the design? Why don't you try to improve it? Any 
contribution is welcome!

P.S. Work is in progress to publish the template at 
[LaTeXTemplatex.com](https://www.latextemplates.com), therefore from now 
on the code should meet the requirements for the site: extensive 
commenting and separation of content into clearly labelled blocks.

## TODO

* replace geometry with typearea (?)

* improve the documentation

* make up mind on margintoc
